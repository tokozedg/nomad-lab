Before starting this lab, it's required to prepare a single node server.

1. Install docker (follow official documentation for you OS)
2. Install Nomad
3. Run nomad in dev mode: `sudo nomad agent -dev -bind=0.0.0.0 -network-interface=eth0 -data-dir=/data/` - set your actual interface instead of eth0.
4. Optionally run `nomad -autocomplete-install` and restart shell session.

# Nomad CLI: Job Operations Quick Guide

## Core Workflow

1.  **Validate Job Spec:**
    ```bash
    nomad job validate myjob.nomad
    ```
    *Checks syntax and basic configuration.*

2.  **Plan Changes:** (Dry Run)
    ```bash
    nomad job plan myjob.nomad
    # With variables:
    # nomad job plan -var "image_tag=v2" myjob.nomad
    ```
    *Shows what changes Nomad would make if you run/update the job. Essential before applying.*

3.  **Run / Update Job:**
    ```bash
    nomad job run myjob.nomad
    # nomad job run -check-index 0 myjob.nomad
    ```
    *Submits a new job or updates an existing one. Nomad is idempotent; `run` handles both creation and updates.*

4.  **Check Status:**
    ```bash
    nomad job status myjob_id
    nomad job status -verbose myjob_id  # More details
    nomad alloc status <alloc_id_from_job_status> # Status of specific allocation
    ```
    *View current status, desired/placed/running allocations.*

5.  **View Logs:**
    ```bash
    nomad alloc logs <alloc_id>
    nomad alloc logs -f <alloc_id> <task_name> # Follow logs for a specific task
    ```
    *Stream or view logs from tasks within an allocation.*

## Key Operations

**Inspect Job Spec:**
```bash
nomad job inspect myjob_id
```
*Shows the full job specification as Nomad sees it.*

**Rollback:**
1.  See available versions:
    ```bash
    nomad job history myjob_id
    ```
2.  Rollback to a specific version:
    ```bash
    nomad job rollback myjob_id <version_number>
    ```
    *Reverts the job to a previous successfully deployed version.*

**Stop Job:**
```bash
nomad job stop myjob_id
# To stop AND remove from Nomad's history (GC'd allocations, not immediate):
# nomad job stop -purge myjob_id
```
*Stops all allocations for the job.*

**Dispatch (for parameterized/batch jobs):**
```bash
nomad job dispatch -meta "key=value" -payload "payload.json" myjob_id
```
*Triggers a new instance of a parameterized or batch job.*

**Scale Task Group Count:**
```bash
nomad job scale myjob_id -group <group_name> -count <N>
# Check current scale first: nomad job status myjob_id
```
*Adjusts the `count` for a specific task group.*

## Plan and Check Index
**Goal:** Ensure the job you're updating hasn't been changed by someone else since you last planned/inspected it. This prevents accidental overwrites of recent changes.

**What is `check-index`?**

It's a value (an integer, specifically the `ModifyIndex`) representing the version of a job definition stored in Nomad.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Plan Your Changes:**
    *   Make your edits to `myjob.nomad`.
    *   Run `nomad job plan myjob.nomad`
    *   Examine the output carefully. Look for the line:
        ```
        Job Modify Index: <INDEX_NUMBER>
        ```
        Example: `Job Modify Index: 12345`
    *   **This `<INDEX_NUMBER>` is what you'll use for `check-index`.**

2.  **Review the Plan:**
    *   Is the plan doing what you expect? (e.g., updating 2 instances, creating 1 new, etc.)

3.  **Run with `check-index` (If Plan is Good):**
    *   `nomad job run -check-index <INDEX_NUMBER_FROM_PLAN> myjob.nomad`
    *   Example: `nomad job run -check-index 12345 myjob.nomad`

**How it Works:**

*   When you run with `-check-index`, Nomad compares the index you provided with the current `ModifyIndex` of the job on the server.
*   **If they match:** Your update proceeds.
*   **If they DON'T match:** Someone else modified the job since you ran `plan`. Nomad will REJECT your update with an error like:
    ```
    Error submitting job: Unexpected response code: 409 (Expected an index of 12345 but got 12346)
    ```

**What if `check-index` fails?**

1.  **Re-plan:** Run `nomad job plan myjob.nomad` again.
2.  **Review:** See what changed. You might need to merge their changes into your `myjob.nomad` or decide your changes are no longer needed/valid.
3.  **Re-run:** Get the new `ModifyIndex` from the new plan and use that with `nomad job run -check-index ...`.

**Alternative to get `ModifyIndex` (if not using `plan` output directly):**
`nomad job inspect <job_id> | grep ModifyIndex`

**Why is this good for Nomads?**
When working remotely, possibly with intermittent connectivity or in teams, this prevents you from clobbering a colleague's urgent hotfix that was deployed seconds before your planned change. It's a safety net.

**In short:**
`plan` -> get `ModifyIndex` -> `run -check-index <ModifyIndex>` = Safe Update!
